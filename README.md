# Project Overview
This project is a site that uses the Riot Games API to simulate a mini-game between friends during League of Legends games.

Masteries Adventures allows you to search for a League of Legends profile, and view its information and champion mastery level.

The site then features a randomizer that allows you to play a champion from among your own and chosen roles, until you raise his or her mastery level.
